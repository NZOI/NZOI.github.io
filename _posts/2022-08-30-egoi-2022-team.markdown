A team has been chosen to represent New Zealand at the 2022 European Girls Olympiad in
Informatics. This event will be held in October in Turkey, and is only offered on-site. Unfortunately, the costs associated with travel and the risk of potential travel disruptions have made it impossible to attend.

The team chosen is pictured below.
