*I had an incredible time at EGOI and learning how powerful and useful this skill of programming is has made me certain this is what I want to do with my future. I feel incredibly inspired to continue training, learning and pursuing programming. I have always loved technology, and this event only increased that love.*

*One of the best parts of attending this event was getting to meet other people who are passionate about programming. Being surrounded by people who are all interested in something I’m interested in was incredible.*

*I wouldn’t trade this experience for the world. I feel so incredibly grateful to have been able to do this, and I’m so excited to keep training to hopefully compete again next year. And, to prepare for my future in this field, which looks incredibly bright.*
