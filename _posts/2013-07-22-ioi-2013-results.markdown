Our magnificent team have returned from the IOI with two bronze medals, after two tense contest days!
Both Tony and Logan have scored bronze medals, with Tony being __very__ close to a silver. Byung-Hoon and Alan Ansell were both very close to medal potential, and we look forward to seeing what they will be doing in the future!
