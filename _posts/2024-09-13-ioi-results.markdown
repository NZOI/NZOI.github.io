The 36th International Olympiad in Informatics has wrapped up, with all the contestants gathering in Cairo infront of the Sphinx and the Great Pyramids of Giza for a grandiose closing ceremony.

This year saw Guanhan receive New Zealand's first silver medal at the IOI in 16 years! Rather poetically, last time NZ earned a silver medal was at IOI 2008, also held in Egypt!

Out of 354 official contestants, Guanhan earned 308.21 points, placing 70th. Victor earned 235.47 points, placing 155th and earning a bronze medal. Jesse earned 143.83 points and placed 265th and Peter earned 101.31 points, placing 292nd. We would like to congratulate the entire team on these incredible results!

Between the two contest days the team went for an excursion at Montazah Beach for a little relaxation and before the closing ceremony they got to visit the Egyptian Grand Museum in Cairo.
