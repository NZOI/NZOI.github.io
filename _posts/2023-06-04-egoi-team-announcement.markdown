The team to represent New Zealand at the European Girls Olympiad in Informatics 2023 has been chosen. All the girls are from Auckland. Jasmine is at ACG Parnell College, Belle and Ena attend St Cuthbertâ€™s and Phoebe attends Rangitoto College.

The event was intended to be only on-site, but as this prohibited some teams from attending (costs), the event organisers generously decided to also allow on-line participation. 

The team will sit the 2 contests at AUT on July 17 and July 19.
