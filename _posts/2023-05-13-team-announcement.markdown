The team consists of Anatol Coen (Mt Albert Grammar), GuanHan Li (Sunnynook Primary), Jonathon Sun (Rangitoto College) and Phoebe Zhang (Rangitoto College). The reserve is Arshia Lotfi (Macleans College).

IOI 2023 is to be held in Szeged, Hungary from 28th of August to 4th of September. The team will be led by Suzanne Scott and Zalan Varga.

They have been training hard and spent the April school holidays joining in with the Australian Informatics April camp run by AMT. The first half was conducted virtually and then 3 of the team travelled to Sydney for further onsite training. That trip was led by Bruce Chen.
